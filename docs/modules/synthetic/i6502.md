# `i6502` & `i6502x`
***
Below are synthetic implieds that use an idtable to give GPRs pseudo-operand functionality, all take `4` cycles when not page crossing and `3` bytes. This could not be more optimal, if ever these instructions take more than `4` cycles then you have likely setup your tables incorrect. 

The following instructions that are exception are `sev` and `laxi`, furthermore, `laxi` requires a constant operand.

| opcode  | name                  |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| `adx`   | Add X with Carry      |
| `ady`   | Add Y with Carry      |
| `sbx`   | Subtract X with Carry |
| `sby`   | Subtract Y with Carry |
| `xset`  | Set by X              |
| `yset`  | Set by Y              |
| `xmask` | Mask by X             |
| `ymask` | Mask by Y             |
| `xflip` | Flip by X             |
| `yflip` | Flip by Y             |
| `biti`  | Bitcheck Immediate    |
| `xcmp`  | Compare against X     |
| `ycmp`  | Compare against Y     |
| `xcpy`  | Compare X against Y   |
| `ycpx`  | Compare Y against X   |
| `txy`   | Transfer X to Y       |
| `tyx`   | Transfer Y to X       |
| `sev`   | Set Overflow          |
| `tyxa`  | Transfer Y to X & A   |
| `laxi`  | Load A & X Immediate  |
