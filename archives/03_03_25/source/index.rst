``nesbrette``
=============

The ``nesbrette`` library is currently still seriously in development and not for use for others as of yet. The first wave of development will see the library enter a usable state in which everything is tested as is listed here in docs during phase 1. After Phase 1 ``nesbrette`` will incur a silent period in which `Mesen2G <https://github.com/brette-0/Mesen2-G>`_ is being worked on, in which case on return Phase 2 will begin.


.. warning::
   ``nesbrette`` source does **not** match docs at this point time as we are in a 'limbo' state while restarting the libarry. The project is *not* dead, however, due to poor planning its clear that a restart is required.  ``nesbrette`` pushes ``ca65`` to its limits and for this it pays the penalty of a restart being *necessary* where other libs may not have had that excuse.

   This message will be sustained until Phase 1 is complete - do not engage with project until this message is removed.
