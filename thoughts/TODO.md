> Warnings acting like Fatal or Error on user specification (like a Pedantic Mode)
> Warnings for (memory + width) page overlaps (likely intentional, *however* if not; potentially catastrophic)
> Warning Disabled / Pedantic Warnigns as arguements for macros (more useful than it sounds)
> Auto-Dependancy system (Don't specify includes, use features to activate includes?)
>   Note : if library becomes expansive, users could loose track of PRG/CPU from recklessly adding features
