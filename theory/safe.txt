Block:
    reads, writes on STACK
    execute on any kind of deterministic ram, open bus, register space
    Situations with Dummy Reads for open bus, register space
    Situations with Dummy writes for open bus, register space

    Writes to ROM


'Unsafe Regions'

Stack ($100-$200, $900-$a00, $1100 - $1200, $1900-$1a00)
PPU   ($2000-$4000)
APU   ($4000-$4020)

The rest is cart space, must be defined by libcore::header
